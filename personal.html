	<p>I'm not a very personal guy, so I'm not about to tell you a lot about
my pets (I don't have any, but some of my best friends do), not to
mention my kids (I do have some), and so on.  But I figured I could at the least put up another picture of myself.  It's from 1997, though, so
you might not recognize me.  <a href="mynd-af-mer.html">Here</a> it
is.  And here is a picture of my brother. He's the one in sunglasses:
<a href="bro.html">My bro</a></p>

<p>Students sometimes worry about how to adress me properly.  <a href="genealogy.html">Here</a>  are instructions about that.

<p>My personal email address is <a href="mailto:einar@alum.mit.edu">einar@alum.mit.edu</a></p>

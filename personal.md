I\'m not a very personal guy, so I\'m not about to tell you a lot about
my pets (I don\'t have any, but some of my best friends do), not to
mention my kids (I do have some), and so on. But I figured I could at
the least put up another picture of myself. It\'s from 1997, though, so
you might not recognize me. [Here](mynd-af-mer.html) it is. And here is
a picture of my brother. He\'s the one in sunglasses: [My bro](bro.html)

Students sometimes worry about how to adress me properly.
[Here](genealogy.html) are instructions about that.

My personal email address is <einar@alum.mit.edu>
